## Overview

This repository is designed to the practical implementation of essential algorithms and data structures. It includes:

- Implementations of sorting algorithms
- Using sorting algorithms to determine a participant's ranking in a programming olympiad.
- Implementation of a binary tree class `In development`
- Various graph-related tasks `TO DO:`

The aim is to provide a hands-on approach to learning through well-structured code and clear examples.
